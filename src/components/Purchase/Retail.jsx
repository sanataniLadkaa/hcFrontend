      <h1>Retail Property for Sale</h1>
      <p>
        Retail properties are commercial properties where businesses sell goods and services to customers.
        Investing in retail properties can provide stable rental income or be an excellent location for your own retail business.
      </p>
      <p>
        When buying retail space, consider factors such as foot traffic, location, accessibility, and the existing tenant mix.
      </p>
      <h2>Important Considerations for Buying Retail Property</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Location: High foot traffic areas or prime locations can attract more customers and tenants.</li>
        <li>Size: Choose a retail space that suits your business requirements or investment goals.</li>
        <li>Legal Documentation: Verify zoning regulations and ensure the property has clear titles and ownership.</li>
        <li>Infrastructure: Check if the property has the necessary utilities and amenities for retail use.</li>
      </ul>
      
    </div>
