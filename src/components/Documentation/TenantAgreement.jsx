        A tenant agreement is a contract between the property owner (landlord) and the person renting the property (tenant).
        It contains information about the property, responsibilities, and rights of both parties.

      <p>
        The tenant agreement is crucial to ensure that both parties understand the terms and conditions of the tenancy.
        It covers aspects like rent payment, lease duration, and maintenance responsibilities.
